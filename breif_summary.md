This document provides a summary of the challenges, assumptions, and time log for the Goldilocks technical assignment.

### Queries & Challenges Faced and Resolutions

As per the assignment instructions I've noted any unclear points stated my assumptions and then solved the problem.

* **Java Q3 (Database Connection):** The prompt provided a table name (`test`) but not a database name (schema).
    * **Assumption:** I created a new database named `goldilocks_db` to hold the `test` table. This is noted in the `Ques3.java` code.

* **Java Q4 (HTTP Client):** The URL `http://127.0.0.1:8999/test` pointed to a local server that was not running.
    * **Assumption:** I assumed this client was intended to be tested against the server from Q6.
    * **Resolution:** I built the `Ques4` client to handle the "Connection refused" error gracefully. I also added a test call to a public API (`api.ipify.org`) to prove the client code works correctly.

* **Java Q6 (HTTP Server):** This question required combining Q3 (DB read) and Q4 (HTTP).
    * **Assumption:** I built the server to listen on the specific port `8999` and the path `/test` to successfully answer the client from Q4.

* **DB Q2c ("records not in A and not in B"):** This was ambiguous.
    * **Assumption:** I interpreted this as finding the "symmetric difference"â€”records that are in *either* A or B, but *not* in both. The query reflects this.

* **Linux Q7 (JSON to CSV):** The "simple structure" was not defined.
    * **Assumption:** I assumed this meant a flat JSON object per line (e.g., `{"id": 1, "name": "Alice"}`). I provided a robust solution using `jq` and a simpler, less-reliable one using `sed`.
